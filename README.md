# 📊 Findings: Palmora HR Gender Analytics
This report summarizes key insights from Palmora’s workforce dataset using Excel pivot tables and visual dashboards. The goal was to identify disparities, monitor equity efforts, and drive evidence-based HR decisions.

🔹 1. Gender Representation by Department
Insight: Some departments (e.g., Engineering, IT) have a predominantly male workforce, while others (e.g., HR, Customer Service) show higher female representation. These patterns reflect broader industry trends but highlight opportunities for targeted recruitment in underrepresented areas.

🔹 2. Average Salary by Gender and Role
Insight: While the average salary gap is narrowing in administrative roles, higher-paying managerial and technical roles still show a significant disparity favoring male employees.

🔹 3. Promotions by Gender
Insight: Promotion data reveals that male employees received ~60% of promotions in the past year, though female representation in the eligible pool was near 50%. This points to potential bias or differences in opportunity access.

🔹 4. Top 5 Job Titles by Gender
Insight: Male employees are most often in roles such as Engineer, IT Analyst, and Sales Executive, while female employees dominate in roles like HR Coordinator, Customer Rep, and Admin Assistant.

🔹 5. Gender Pay Gap by Department
Insight: Departments like Finance and Marketing show minimal pay gaps, while gaps are wider in Tech and Sales. Further review is needed to identify causes (e.g., role seniority, performance bonuses).

🔹 6. Promotions vs Experience by Gender
Insight: On average, male employees are promoted with 4.5 years of experience, compared to 5.2 years for females. This may suggest gender differences in recognition timing.

🔹 7. Recent Promotion Gender Breakdown
Insight: Only 38% of employees promoted in the last 12 months were female. This is disproportionate to the number of eligible women in the workforce and should be investigated further.

🔹 8. Tenure and Salary Patterns
Insight: Males show slightly steeper salary growth over time. For similar tenure levels, female salaries trail behind by 8–12% on average.

🔹 9. Balanced Departments
Insight: HR, Legal, and Marketing departments show the most gender-balanced staffing, offering a model for best practices in hiring and promotion.

🔹 10. Department Size by Gender
Insight: Departments like Operations and IT have significantly more male employees, while Admin and HR are female-dominant. These distributions may influence promotion visibility and team dynamics.

# ✅ Final Recommendations
Review promotion criteria and decision-making for implicit bias.

Prioritize equal pay reviews for roles in Sales, Tech, and Management.

Target hiring efforts to diversify underrepresented departments.

Encourage mentorship and leadership pipelines for women in technical roles.

Maintain progress in balanced departments by reinforcing inclusive practices.
